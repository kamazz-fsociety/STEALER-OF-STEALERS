# Stealer of the Stealers
## By Right Decision



## Instruction

First of all, of course, you need to find a stiller that sends logs to a person in a telegram. There are different ways to do this. For example, you can search on YouTube for videos with cheats, sorting them by upload date.
On the move, of course, it will not be possible to determine where the stiller sends logs and whether it is a stiller at all, so you will have to spend a little time.

We download all the cheats from YouTube, throw them to our virtual machine / dedic, open some HTTP Debugger and reduce stiller requests.

Here is an example that I found:

Moving on. To further automate the work, I wrote a simple software on sharp, which will throw off logs from this stiller to you.
The first two parameters specify the your chat ID and the chat ID from the request, and then specify token from request.
Then you will need to choose count of messages, to redirect. That's all then everything will start!
